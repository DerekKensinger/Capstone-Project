Introduction

The Mode Push DFS Formula 1 App is a tool designed to assist fantasy Formula 1 players in creating optimal driver lineups for their fantasy teams. It utilizes optimization techniques to select the best combination of drivers while adhering to salary constraints and roster position rules.

Features
- Generates fantasy Formula 1 lineups based on provided driver data, salary constraints, and weather conditions.
- Allows users to define custom constraints such as roster positions and salary cap.
- Optimizes lineups for maximum expected points within the given constraints.
- Gives current events, news, and circuit information about that particular week in on the F1 Schedule.

Technologies
- Python
- Pulp (Linear Programming Library)
- pandas (Data Manipulation Library)
- openpyxl (Excel Interaction Library)
- GitHub (Version Control and Collaboration)
- [DraftKings API ](https://www.example.com/draftkings-api) (Used to source driver data)
